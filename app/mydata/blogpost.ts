    title: "What is HTML?",
    description: "HyperText Markup Language",
    content:
      "HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web page's appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior (JavaScript). 'Hypertext' refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or between websites. Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet and linking it to pages created by other people, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web. HTML uses 'markup' to annotate text, images, and other content for display in a Web browser. HTML markup includes special 'elements' such as <head>, <title>, <body>, <header>, <footer>, <article>, <section>, <p>, <div>, <span>, <img>, <aside>, <audio>, <canvas>, <datalist>, <details>, <embed>, <nav>, <search>, <output>, <progress>, <video>, <ul>, <ol>, <li>, and many others. An HTML element is set off from other text in a document by 'tags', which consist of the element name surrounded by < and >. The name of an element inside a tag is case-insensitive. That is, it can be written in uppercase, lowercase, or a mixture. For example, the <title> tag can be written as <Title>, <TITLE>, or in any other way. However, the convention and recommended practice is to write tags in lowercase.",

    title: "What is CSS?",
    description: "Cascading Style Sheets",
    content:
      "Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML, or XHTML). CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media. CSS is among the core languages of the open web and is standardized across Web browsers according to W3C specifications. Previously, the development of various parts of the CSS specification was done synchronously, which allowed the versioning of the latest recommendations. You might have heard about CSS1, CSS2.1, or even CSS3. There will never be a CSS3 or a CSS4; rather, everything is now just 'CSS' with individual CSS modules having version numbers.",

    title: "What is JS?",
    description: "JavaScript",
    content:
      "JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight interpreted (or just-in-time compiled) programming language with first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB, and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g., functional programming) styles. JavaScript's dynamic capabilities include runtime object construction, variable parameter lists, function variables, dynamic script creation (via eval), object introspection (via for...in and Object utilities), and source-code recovery (JavaScript functions store their source text and can be retrieved through toString()).",

      "React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you create reusable components to build dynamic and efficient web applications.\n\nCore React Features:\n- **Components**: React lets you build encapsulated components that manage their own state.\n- **Virtual DOM**: React uses a virtual DOM to optimize rendering performance.\n- **JSX**: JSX allows you to write HTML-like syntax in JavaScript for defining UI components.\n- **Hooks**: React hooks like `useState` and `useEffect` enable functional components to manage state and lifecycle methods.\n- **State Management**: React components can manage their own state, and you can also use Context API or external libraries like Redux for global state.\n- **Event Handling**: React offers a declarative approach to handling user inputs, such as clicks and form submissions.",
